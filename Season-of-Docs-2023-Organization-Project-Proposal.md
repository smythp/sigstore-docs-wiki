# Update, Reorganize, and Expand the Sigstore Docs

## About your organization

[Sigstore](https://sigstore.dev) offers a new standard for signing, verifying and protecting software. Enabling developers to sign and validate software, Sigstore offers simple solutions through keyless signing and transparency logs so that security can be seamlessly integrated into the development process. Sigstore offers a suite of technologies that include Cosign for signing software artifacts, the Fulcio certificate authority, the Rekor transparency log, Gitsign for signing Git commits, and policy-controller to enforce policies on Kubernetes clusters based on verifiable supply-chain metadata. These tools can be used independently, or as one single process, for a holistic approach to open source security.
 
Since its founding in 2020, over 1,000 developers have contributed to Sigstore to date, and there have been over 16 million entries of software artifact signatures logged in the Rekor transparency log. Additionally, a number of package managers, including npm and PyPI, have committed to adopting Sigstore in order to build increased trust and transparency in their respective software ecosystems. Offering a wax seal of security in the digital era, Sigstore has become a popular addition to the developer toolkit.

## About your project

### Your project's problem

Sigstore is a security tool that is being increasingly adopted by the developer community. Over the past few months, there have been a number of major improvements, including new versions of existing tools, and new tool development. While these developments have been exciting, our documentation site has not been equipped to keep up. As we are moving into more language communities, through the npm and PyPI adoption of Sigstore, it is crucial that our documentation is easy to understand by all developers, not just those with a background in security. We have already done an audit of the documentation, but can benefit from the perspective of those who are new to Sigstore to support the update and reorganization process.

### Your project's scope

The key objectives of this project are: 
* Onboard to Sigstore while keeping a friction log.
* Update and test documentation against current versions of Sigstore tools.
* Review friction log to make recommendations, and get buy-in from community members on a documentation reorganization.
* Create user-friendly on-ramps to Sigstore.

The major documentation goals of this project are: 
* Support the onboarding of new developer-users to Sigstore.
* Serve as reference material for experienced Sigstore developer-users.
* Expand documentation based on reorganization.

Work that is out-of-scope for this project:
* Long-term, Sigstore would benefit from processes to ensure that documentation does not go out of date, but building a process is beyond the scope of this project.

## Measuring your project’s success

The project will be successful if the Sigstore docs are updated and effectively reorganized, thus enabling both new and experienced users to leverage Sigstore effectively. The following metrics will indicate that our project is a success:
* Decrease in user help-related messages on the Sigstore Slack due to outdated docs
* Decrease the amount of drifting-away contributors (based on Linux Foundation Insights
* Monthly new unique visitor counts to documentation increase by at least 10%
* Monthly returning visitor counts to documentation increase by at least 10%
* At least 2 new contributors filing issues or making a pull request to Sigstore documentation

## Timeline

The project will take approximately six months to complete. After the technical writer is hired, we'll begin with orientation and onboarding (including asking the technical writer to keep a friction log). Once the technical writer is settled in, they will jump into updates, reorganizing, and expanding the Sigstore docs.

Month     | Action Items
--------- | ----------------
May       | Technical writer orientation, including software setup and onboarding with a friction log, begin updates
June      | Complete all technical updates on current docs to ensure recent software changes are reflected in documentation
July      | Review current organization against friction log, make recommendations for new organization, and socialize with the community 
August    | Implement reorganization with feedback from community, note any missing documentation
September | Complete reorganization by filling in with any missing documentation that completes the new organization
October   | Test the updates and new organization, make any needed corrections
November  | Project completion, case study, and evaluation

## Project Budget

Budget item | Amount | Running Total | Notes/justifications
-- | -- | -- | --
Technical writer | 15,000.00 | 15,000.00 |  20 hours a week, 26 weeks = $28.85 per hour

## Additional information

[Lisa Tagliaferri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-tagliaferri/) is the maintainer of Sigstore docs and will serve as a mentor and community liaison. The technical writer working with Sigstore docs will be part of a growing community of Sigstore contributors, and will benefit from the knowledge of the extended community. They will be invited to join Sigstore community calls twice a month.
